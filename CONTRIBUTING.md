# Contributing to Gaseous

All contributions are welcome!

If you have a change, suggestion, feature request, or code you'd like to submit to a Gaseous project, we'd love to see what you come up with.

## Contributing suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests

These can be submitted using the Issues tab for the project you wish to contribute to.

Make your comments as detailed as possible to ensure we understand your suggestion and to give it the best change of being accepted and worked on.

## Contributing code

Of course, code is always welcome!

To contribute code:
1. Fork the project into your own profile
2. Create a new branch with a short name that describes the contribution (for example: new-toolbar-button-to-add-games)
3. Create and test your changes locally
4. Create a Pull Request to submit your changes - describe the change you're making, why you're making it, and any other pertinent information.
5. We'll review and test the submission. Discussion about the change will happen against the PR
6. Once approved it'll be merged into the main branch ready for the next release
